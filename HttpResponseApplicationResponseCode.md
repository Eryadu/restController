## HTTP response codes are standardized numerical codes (like 200, 404, 500) that indicate the status of a request made
  to a web server. Application-specific codes, on the other hand, are custom error codes or status codes used within the
  context of a specific application to communicate details about application-level errors or events.

## HTTP Response Codes:
-- Standardized: Defined by the HTTP protocol and are commonly used to indicate the success or failure of a web request.
-- Examples: 200 OK (successful), 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error.
-- Purpose: Communicate the overall result of a web request to the client (e.g., browser, API).
-- Scope: Broader than application-specific codes, applying to all web requests.

## Application-Specific Codes:
-- Custom:
   Designed by the application developer to provide more granular information about errors or events specific to 
   the application.
Examples:
-- Error codes like "Invalid login credentials," "Order processing failed," or "Database connection error".
-- Purpose:
   Provide more detailed information to the client about the specific reason for an error or event within the application.
-- Scope:
   Specific to the application's logic and error handling.
-- In essence:
   HTTP response codes provide a general indication of success or failure at the network level.

## Application-specific codes offer a more precise, application-level view of errors or events.
## Why use both?
  HTTP codes provide a foundational understanding of whether the request was successful.
  Application-specific codes provide the client with more specific reasons for errors or failures, aiding in debugging
  and user feedback.
  For example, an HTTP 200 code might indicate a successful request, but an application-specific code within the
  response body could further specify that the user's login was successful, or that an order was processed successfully.

## In simpler terms:
  Imagine you're ordering food online.
  HTTP code:
  The server might return 200 OK, indicating the order was received and processed successfully.
  Application-specific code:
  The application might then display an error message like "Invalid address." or "Order processing failed due to 
  insufficient stock," providing more details about the specific issue.
