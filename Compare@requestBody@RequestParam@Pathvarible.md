## Why @RequestBody is more secure than @PathVariable and @RequestParam?
It’s not that @RequestBody is inherently secure by itself, but rather it is less prone to common risks when used properly.

✅ 1. Less Exposure in URLs (Path/Query)

🔓 @PathVariable and @RequestParam:
These are part of the URL.
URLs are logged in server logs, browser history, proxies, or even analytics tools.
This means sensitive data like passwords, tokens, or personal info can leak.
GET /user/login?username=admin&password=1234       ← BAD
GET /user/1234                                       ← BAD if 1234 is sensitive
🔐 @RequestBody:
The data is sent in the HTTP body, not in the URL.
It’s not visible in browser history, logs, or bookmarks.
Hence, more private and harder to leak.
POST /user/login
{
"username": "admin",
"password": "1234"
}
✅ 2. Better suited for encrypted channels

HTTP bodies (used by @RequestBody) are more efficiently encrypted over HTTPS.
URLs might still be partially logged in some middleboxes or servers.
Therefore, sensitive payloads in body stay confidential.
✅ 3. Validation and Structure

@RequestBody allows well-defined request structures using DTOs.
You can easily add validation annotations like @NotNull, @Size, etc.
public class LoginRequest {
@NotBlank
private String username;
@NotBlank
private String password;
}
→ This helps prevent attacks like parameter tampering or missing parameters.

✅ 4. Prevents Overexposure

Query params and path variables are easy to guess or brute-force.
@RequestBody endpoints tend to use POST/PUT/PATCH, which don’t expose data like GET requests.

Data inURL	                    ✅ Yes	                ❌ No
Visible in logs / bookmarks 	✅ Often	            ❌ Rare
Suited for sensitive info	    ❌ No	                ✅ Yes
Structured validation	        ❌ Limited           	✅ Strong via DTO
Common use wit HTTP GET     	✅ Yes	                ❌ No (POST/PUT/PATCH)
Better HTTPS security	        ⚠️ Less effective	    ✅ More effective

🔚 Final Verdict

Use @RequestBody for sensitive or complex data, especially passwords, tokens, user input forms, etc.
Use @PathVariable and @RequestParam for simple, non-sensitive, and safe-to-expose data like IDs, filters, or sorting options.
