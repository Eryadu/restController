## Consuming API
Try open API i.e. Git hub -> getUser API

Rest Template ? Most basic used in Spring Boot, We use it to for http client to consume RestAPI.

Practice RestTemplate, webClient, FeignClient ?
Try All the methode of webClient
Try all API with two services


Rest is using HTTP protocol : HTTP any method

SOAP is Protocol : HTTP Post
getForEntity and exchange ??

Work :-> if data present it fetch from db not from API 

For WebClient for need Dependency webFlux

Let surf can we use same method or code for both Rest and Soap Api ?

Note : We prefer Header to pass Authentication ID (login Info).

bodyToFlux is used when whole code is in Reactive programming
bodyToMono is similar to optional, hold one object.
