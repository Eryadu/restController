Q. SLF4J provides a common interface and abstraction for most of the Java logging frameworks. It acts as a facade
and provides a standardized API for accessing the underlying features of the logging framework.
Facade : The facade pattern (also spelled façade) is a software design pattern commonly used in object-oriented 
programming. Analogous to a façade in architecture, it is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking 
more complex underlying or structural code

What Is SLF4J
The SLF4J or the Simple Logging Facade for Java is an abstraction layer for various Java logging frameworks, like 
Log4j 2 or Logback. This allows for plugging different logging frameworks at deployment time without the need for 
code changes.

Why Should You Use It
The Simple Logging Facade for Java allows us to decouple the code that is used to create log events from the 
implementation that will be responsible for processing and storing them in a way we want. For example, in a 
file or in an external log centralization system like Sematext Logs. This kind of approach allows choosing the 
logging framework such as Log4j 2 or Loback during compilation just by using a different library that uses the 
SLF4J API.

## SLF4J Levels

A level or severity is connected to a log event. It tells how important a log event is. In most logging frameworks
you will find a common set of log levels and SLF4J is not different. The following log levels can be used when 
choosing the SLF4J as your logging library abstraction:

1. TRACE – log events with this level are the most fine-grained and are usually not needed unless you need to have the 
full visibility of what is happening in your application and inside the third-party libraries that you use. You can 
expect the TRACE logging level to be very verbose.
2. DEBUG – less granular compared to the TRACE level, but still more than you will need in everyday use. The DEBUG 
log level should be used for information that may be needed for deeper diagnostics and troubleshooting.
3. INFO – the standard log level indicating that something happened, application processed a request, etc. The information
logged using the INFO log level should be purely informative and not looking into them on a regular basis shouldn’t 
result in missing any important information.
4. WARN – the log level that indicates that something unexpected happened in the application. For example a problem, 
or a situation that might disturb one of the processes, but the whole application is still working.
5. ERROR – the log level that should be used when the application hits an issue preventing one or more functionalities 
from properly functioning. The ERROR log level can be used when one of the payment systems is not available, but there
is still the option to check out the basket in the e-commerce application or when your social media logging option is
not working for some reason. You can also see the ERROR log level associated with exceptions.
6. FATAL – the log level that tells that the application encountered an event or entered a state in which one of 
the crucial business functionality is no longer working. A FATAL log level may be used when the application is not 
able to connect to a crucial data store like a database or all the payment systems are not available and users can’t 
checkout their baskets in your e-commerce.


## SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) is a logging API that acts as an abstraction layer, allowing you to write 
logging statements without being tied to a specific logging framework. It functions as a facade, meaning it provides 
a consistent interface for logging, while delegating the actual logging to an underlying implementation like Logback 
or Log4j. This decoupling of the application code from the logging implementation allows for flexibility and easy 
switching between different logging frameworks.
Here's a breakdown of how it works:
1. SLF4J provides an API:
   Developers use SLF4J's Logger interface and its methods (e.g., debug(), info(), warn(), error()) to write log messages.
2. Dynamic Binding:
   At runtime, SLF4J dynamically binds to a specific logging implementation (like Logback or Log4j) based on what's
   available on the classpath. This binding is determined by the "SLF4J binding" JAR that matches the chosen logging 
   framework.
3. Delegation:
   Once bound, SLF4J forwards the log messages to the chosen logging framework for processing and output (e.g., 
   writing to a file, console, or database).
   
## Key Benefits:
   Flexibility:
   You can easily switch logging frameworks by simply including the appropriate SLF4J binding and removing the old one.
   Decoupling:
   The application code remains independent of the specific logging implementation.
   Consistency:
   Provides a standard API for logging regardless of the underlying framework.
   Extensibility:
   Can be used with various logging frameworks, including Logback, Log4j, and the standard Java logging API.
   Example:
   Java

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class MyClass {
private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);

    public void doSomething() {
        logger.info("Doing something...");
    }
}
In this example, the logger.info() call will be handled by the underlying logging framework configured at runtime.
